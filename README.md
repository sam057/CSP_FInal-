About Me: 
My name is Sam and I am in two different PLTW classes, AP Computer Science and Principles of Engineering. PLTW classes, I think are fun. I really liked woods in 9th grade with mr. Loman. I also have a dog and a cat at home my cat's name is Mickey and my dog's name is willie they get along very well and usually just sit around and sleep. 
My Project:
During the creation of my website for AP Computer Science I used many different programs to help build. I used php files to build the website and tell everything what it does, where it does it, and how it does it. The connect.php part of my project helps direct all of the information in the right places, and connects the database with the cloud 9 project. With CSS files I help make the website look presentable to other people. With adding colors and making it when their is a cursor over a button it highlights it to tell the user that they can click the button. 
Project Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to create a website with different programs. The website that I created is supposed to help me or other people organize the video games that they've played. I created this because sometimes I forget if I played something earlier and I want to go back and finish it or if I've never played something and that I should start to play it. I think this website that I created is helpful for me and other people who want to help organize their video game playing.
